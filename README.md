## ðŸ’» Hardware pre-requisite

- Nvidia Jetson Nano / TX2 / Xavier or any GNU/Linux x86_64 machine with a CUDA compatible GPU with [nvidia-docker v2.0](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/Installation-(version-2.0)#prerequisites) (in the cloud or locally)
- Webcam Logitech C222, C270, C310, C920 / Rasberry Pi cam for Jetson nano / a Video file / IP camera
- A smartphone / tablet / laptop that you will use to operate the system

_If you have a Jetson Nano, [please read this specific documentation](documentation/jetson/JETSON_NANO.md)_

_Also see [In depth guide about compatible Cameras with Jetson](https://elinux.org/Jetson/Cameras)_


## ðŸš¤ How fast is MASANANO ?

FPS depends on:

- which hardware your are running MASANANO on
- which YOLO weights you are using

We made the default settings to run at least at 10 FPS on any Jetson.
